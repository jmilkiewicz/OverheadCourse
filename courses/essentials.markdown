>"You can practice shooting eight hours a day, but if your technique is wrong, then all you become is very good at shooting the wrong way. Get the fundamentals down and the level of everything you do will rise."

This course is dedicated to emphasize the fundamental aspects of padel that are crucial for your growth as a player. Mastering the essentials is not only a stepping stone to becoming a skilled player but also a gateway to unlocking the full potential of your game.

It is worth noting that if you come from a background in tennis, squash, or badminton, you might assume that the basic shots in padel are similar or even identical to those in your previous racket sport. While there may be some similarities, it is crucial to understand that both the technique(block your wrist!) and intention behind these shots in padel are very different.

For example, in tennis, you might rely on powerful swings and generating pace to dominate the game. However, in padel, precision, control, and placement often take precedence over pure power. The shots you execute from the back of the court require a different swing path, adjustment in footwork, and an understanding of how the walls can be utilized to your advantage.

Similarly, if you come from squash or badminton, you might be accustomed to playing close to the walls and hitting shots with a more vertical trajectory. In padel, the tactics and shot selection differ, and you need to adapt your positioning, angles, and shot selection accordingly.

Padel is a unique sport that requires its own set of skills and strategies. The smaller court size, the presence of walls, and the specific rules of padel demand a distinct approach to the game. Therefore, to play padel effectively, it is essential to acknowledge that you may need to unlearn certain techniques and adjust your mindset.
