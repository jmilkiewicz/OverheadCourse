In the fast-paced and dynamic game of padel, defense plays a crucial role in outlasting your opponents and gaining the upper hand. 
This course is dedicated to enhancing your defensive skills and understanding the strategic aspects of padel defense. 
Whether you're a beginner looking to build a strong defensive foundation or an experienced player aiming to refine your defensive techniques, this course is designed to take your defensive game to the next level.

## Course Overview:

- develop defensive skills that will help you withstand your opponents' attacks and maintain control of the game,
- learn the different defensive shots and their specific techniques, including how to play with the back glass, side glass, and double glass effectively,
- master the art of shot placement and varying shot pace to push your opponents back (and counterattack) to gain a tactical advantage,
- improve anticipation and reaction time to handle difficult shots and maintain a solid defensive position

## Expectations:

During training we will focus on following:

- **fundamentals of padel defense**: understand and learn court position and movement of a defending pair, 
- **back/side glass shots**: master defensive shots off the back/side glass, including accurate lobs, controlled clears, chiquitas and bajadas, 
- **double glass shots**: learn how to return ball which hits back-and-side or side-and-back glass with or without turn,
- **lobs**: how and when to use lobs and its different kinds effectively,
- **volleys**: how to defend when being caught at the net and finally regain control of the rally

After attending this course, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the critical role defense plays in padel and how to effectively defend against various shots. They will acquire the skills and knowledge to anticipate and react quickly to shots that touch the side and back glass, enhancing their defensive capabilities. With improved court positioning, shot placement, and communication as a pair, participants will become confident and adept at keeping rallies under their control through strong defensive play.
