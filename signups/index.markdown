## 📅 Event Details 📍

Training sessions will be held from **Saturday, September 30th** to **Tuesday, October 3rd** (German Unity Day)
at <a href="https://wearepadel.com/de/berlin" target="_blank">We Are Padel - Berlin</a>.

*WAP Berlin is conveniently accessible by car on non-working days. 🚗🎾*

## 🔀 Training selection

During this event, Manu will be offering two distinct courses: [Padel Essentials]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link courses/essentials.markdown %}) and [Padel Defence]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link courses/defence.markdown %}). 

We encourage you to carefully read the course descriptions for both programs, taking your time to explore the details of each
and **select** the one that suits you better for your current moment.

### **Padel Essentials 🎯** is aimed at individuals who:
- wants to learn/improve backcourt shots technique (or potentially change their habits from other racket sports) and/or
- struggles with shot selection and/or
- plays non-effective overshots and/or
- misses too many volleys and/or
- avoids playing with glass walls and/or
- being often caught in unfavorable court positions.

### **Padel Defence ⚔️** is tailored for you when you:
- want to focus purely on enhancing your defensive skills,
- struggle with defending back/side/double glass shots and/or
- are unable to transition from defense to attack effectively and/or
- can not play against hard hitters

While it's natural to be ambitious and strive for greatness, rushing without a solid foundation can make more harm than benefits.
If you find yourself unsure about which course to choose, we recommend opting for the *Padel Essentials* over *Defence* for a well-rounded foundation in padel skills.

However, if you still have any further doubts or need assistance with selecting the right course for you, please feel free to contact us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manusoler_padel" target="_blank">@manusoler_padel</a> or <a class="u-email" href="mailto:manupadelin@gmail.com">manupadelin@gmail.com</a>. We are here to help you make the best choice for your padel journey. 

*Please note that detailed training program will be adjusted to the level of experience/skills of participants.*

## 🗓️ Training Plan
A separate group/groups for *Padel Essentials* and *Padel Defence* courses. Each group with 4 participants. 

Each group will experience an intensive **7.5-hour** training program and **2 hours** of unsupervised game:

- 2 hours on Saturday + 0.5 h unsupervised game,  
- 2 hours on Sunday + 0.5 h unsupervised game, 
- 1.5 hour on Monday + 0.5 h unsupervised game,
- 2 hours on Tuesday + 0.5 h unsupervised game 

Specific hours and group allocations will be announced via whatsup at least a one week before the course starts.

### 🎁 Extras

We are considering organizing a small tournament (possibly Americano-style) on Tuesday evenings. However, the feasibility of this tournament depends on the interest and willingness of the participants and availabilities of courts.

To ensure that participants stay energized and focused, we will be providing a variety of (healthy) snacks.
