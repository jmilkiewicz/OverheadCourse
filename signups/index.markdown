Click [here](#training-selection) for a help regarding training selection.

## Dates
Training will be provided from **Saturday 30th** September to **Tuesday 3rd** of October (day of German Unity).

*If you can not make full 4 days, but you are interested in having padel lesson/lessons with Manu, contact <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manusoler_padel" target="_blank">@manusoler_padel</a> or <a class="u-email" href="mailto:manupadelin@gmail.com">manupadelin@gmail.com</a>. Both 1:1 and 1:2 options are available.*

## Training selection

During this event Manu will offer two **distinct** courses.

You will have the opportunity to **select** the one that suits you better for your current moment

### **Padel essentials** is aimed at individuals who:
- wants to learn/improve backcourt shots technique (or potentially change their habits from other racket sports) and/or
- struggles with shot selection and/or
- plays non-effective overshots and/or
- misses too many volleys and/or
- avoids playing with glass walls and/or
- being often caught in unfavorable court positions.

### **Padel defense** is tailored for you when you:
- want to focus purely on enhancing your defensive skills,
- struggle with defending back/side/double glass shots and/or
- are unable to transition from defense to attack effectively and/or
- can not play against hard hitters

While it's natural to be ambitious and strive for greatness, rushing without a solid foundation can make more harm than benefits.
If you find yourself unsure about which course to choose, we recommend opting for the *Padel Essentials* over *Defense* for a well-rounded foundation in padel skills.

However, if you still have any further doubts or need assistance with selecting the right course for you, please feel free to contact us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manusoler_padel" target="_blank">@manusoler_padel</a> or <a class="u-email" href="mailto:manupadelin@gmail.com">manupadelin@gmail.com</a>. We are here to help you make the best choice for your padel journey. 

*Please note that detailed training program will be adjusted to the level of experience/skills of participants.*

## Location
To be announced, but we will train in
<a href="https://wearepadel.com/de/berlin" target="_blank">We Are Padel - Berlin</a> or in  <a href="https://padelfc.com/" target="_blank"> Padel FC </a>

## Training Plan
A separate group/groups for *padel essentials* and *padel defense* courses. Each group with 4 participants. 

For each group:

- 2 hours on Saturday,  
- 2 hours on Sunday, 
- 1.5 hour on Monday,  
- 2 hours on Tuesday 

Specific hours and group allocations will be announced via whatsup at least a one week before the course starts.

### Extras

If you would like to play (within your training group) an extra 0.5 hour after each training let us know (in registration form), and we can arrange it for you (so you will pay only for a court)

We are considering organizing a small tournament (possibly Americano-style) on Tuesday evenings. However, the feasibility of this tournament depends on the interest and willingness of the participants.

To ensure that participants stay energized and focused, we will be providing a variety of (healthy) snacks.

## Registration
Prices:
- 220/250 euro per person for *padels essentials* training (220 euro early bird, 250 euro regular price)
- 250/280 euro per person for *padel defense* training (250 euro early bird, 280 euro regular price)

*Please note that there may be a slight price increase of up to 35 euros per participant (to cover court rentals) if participants decide on additional 0.5 hour of unsupervised game after each training session and/or a 2-hour mini-tournament on Tuesday.*

Total maximum number of participants (for both courses) is **12** and minimum is **8**.
