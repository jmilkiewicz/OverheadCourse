## 📅 Event Details 📍

Training sessions will be held from **Saturday, September 30th** to **Tuesday, October 3rd** (German Unity Day)
at <a href="https://wearepadel.com/de/berlin" target="_blank">We Are Padel - Berlin</a>.

*WAP Berlin is very conveniently accessible by car on non-working days. 🚗🎾*

Training will be provided in English. 

## 🔀 Course selection

This time, Manu will be offering two distinct courses: {% include padelEssentials.markdown %} and {% include padelDefence.markdown %}. 

We encourage you to carefully read the course descriptions for both programs, taking your time to explore the details of each
and **select** the one that suits you better for your current moment.

### {% include padelEssentials.markdown %} is aimed at individuals who:
- wants to learn/improve backcourt shots technique (or potentially change their habits from other racket sports) and/or
- struggles with shot selection and/or
- plays non-effective overshots and/or
- misses too many volleys and/or
- avoids playing with glass walls and/or
- being often caught in unfavorable court positions.

### {% include padelDefence.markdown %} is tailored for you when you:
- want to focus purely on enhancing your defensive skills,
- struggle with defending back/side/double glass shots and/or
- are unable to transition from defense to attack effectively and/or
- can not play against hard hitters

While it's natural to be ambitious and strive for greatness, rushing without a solid foundation can make more harm than benefits.
If you find yourself unsure about which course to choose, we recommend opting for the *{% include padelEssentials.markdown %}* over *{% include padelDefence.markdown %}* for a well-rounded foundation in padel skills.

However, if you still have any further doubts or need assistance with selecting the right course for you, please feel free to contact us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manusoler_padel" target="_blank">@manusoler_padel</a> or <a class="u-email" href="mailto:manupadelin@gmail.com">manupadelin@gmail.com</a>. We are here to help you make the best choice for your padel journey. 

*Please note that detailed training program will be adjusted to the level of experience/skills of participants.*

## 🗓️ Training Plan
A separate group/groups for {% include padelEssentials.markdown %} and {% include padelDefence.markdown %} courses, ensuring participants are grouped based on their similar skill levels, with each group accommodating up to 4 participants.
