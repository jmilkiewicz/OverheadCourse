# Course description

For all padel players (and especially) those with a tennis background, mastering overhead shots can be particularly challenging. Unlike in tennis, padel players have a variety of overhead shots to choose from, each with its own unique technique and purpose. The bandeja, vibora, gancho, rulo and flat/kick smash require quick, agile, and accurate movements, and players must adapt to changing conditions on the court. The varied height and speed of incoming balls can make it difficult to anticipate which overhead shot to use, adding an additional layer of complexity to the learning process. However, with focused training and practice, newcomers and those with a tennis background can master these challenging shots and gain an advantage on the court.

This padel training session is dedicated to improving your skills and knowledge of the three key aspects of executing successful overhead shots: _how_, _where_ and _when_,

- ### How:
Firstly, you will learn the proper technique for each shot, including the correct stance, grip, swing, and follow-through. You will receive personalized guidance and feedback to ensure that you are executing each shot with maximum efficiency and accuracy.
- ### Where:
Secondly, you will learn the optimal placement of each shot based on the position of both yourself and your opponent on the court. You will learn how to strategically place each shot to force your opponent out of position or hit winners that are difficult to return.

- ### When:
Lastly, you will learn when to use each shot based on the situation on the court, such as the speed of the ball, the height of the bounce, and the position of your opponent. By understanding the right time to use each shot, you will be able to anticipate and react to your opponent's shots more effectively.

## Expectations:

During training we will focus on following overhead shots

- **Bandeja**: defensive overhead shot used for lobs, hit with a flat paddle face to create a high, arching shot.
- **Vibora**: quick, angled overhead shot used to catch opponents off guard, hit with a diagonal motion and generating spin.
- **Rulo**: a topspin overhead hit on a lob over oneâ€™s non-dominant shoulder played to a fence (mostly for right-handed player on the left or left-handed on the right)
- **Gancho**: a defensive overhead used to regain the net position, similar to the bandeja but with a higher contact point and normally hit without spin toward the side glass or fence (mostly right-handed right-side players)
- **Flat Smash**: powerful overhead shot hit with a flat paddle face, used to hit the ball with speed and accuracy.
- **Kick Smash**: overhead shot hit with a closed paddle face and a high, upward motion, used to hit a high-bouncing ball with topspin out of a court.

As an experienced instructor, I am committed to tailoring the training program to the level of experience of my participants.
Beginner players can expect to focus on mastering the basics like the bandeja and flat smash, while more advanced players can expect to work on more complex shots like vibora and rulo.

By the end of the training session, you will have developed a deeper understanding of how to play, where to play, and when to play each of the overhead shots, allowing you to elevate your game and dominate the court.
