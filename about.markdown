I'm Manu Soler <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manusoler_padel" target="_blank">@manusoler_padel</a>, a Spanish padel player turned coach. With a strong passion for the sport, I started playing at 12 years old and achieved success in tournaments across Spain. I even competed in the World Padel Tour Junior, facing top players like Ale Gal√°n. As a coach for the past eight years, including training the Qatar national team, I now work as a freelance coach, sharing my expertise to help players excel in padel.
